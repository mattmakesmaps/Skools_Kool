"""
Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one into the other by swapping two letters; for example, “converse” and “conserve.” Write a program that finds all of the metathesis pairs in the dictionary. Hint: don’t test all pairs of words, and don’t test all possible swaps. Solution: http://thinkpython.com/code/metathesis.py. Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at http://puzzlers.org.
